===============================================

You can view your custom blanket pattern at <%= blanket_url(slug: @blanket.slug) %>.

<% if @blanket.ends_in_future? %>
The end date for your blanket pattern is in the future. We will continue adding data each day until your pattern is complete.
<% end %>
