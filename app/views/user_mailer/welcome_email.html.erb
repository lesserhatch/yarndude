<h1>Welcome to <%= Rails.application.config.site_name %>!</h1>
<p>
  We are preparing a preview of your custom blanket pattern at <%= link_to blanket_url(slug: @blanket.slug), blanket_url(slug: @blanket.slug) %>. The full pattern costs $3 (less than a penny per day) and helps pay for server and data costs.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any questions about your blanket pattern, feel free to email me personally and I will help you out.
</p>
<p>Thanks again for using <%= Rails.application.config.site_name %> and have a great day!</p>
<p>Seth Charles</p>
